1. Period hour drop-downs 1 or 2
2. Academic year is fetched during load enrolled students for checking detained/rejoin students and give perfect list
3. Minor change in report screen. Yr --> Year UI change 
4. Bug Fix - If lab is selected it doesnt have any constraint. We can select 7th period and it marks for P7,8,9 which are not even exist in our system.
5. Fixed Firebase_auth/service request that displays errors directly from firestore. now updated to Invalid credentials,etc.
6. Added await before _attendanceService.createAttendance() to ensure it completes before navigating back


After adding billing account update attendance service , change updating student and class summaries to the cloud functions.

Minor Error : Can be neglected. Fac dashboard - bottom navbar - reports - back button - blank screen 
But back gesture works fine, Quick actions Back button works
